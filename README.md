# Emotional Corgum
A gathering of corgi feelings

## Tech Used
+ Ruby on Rails
+ HTML and CSS
+ Postgres database
+ Devise for users and authentication

## Approach Taken
For this rails project, I approached it by working on a single model at a time. Once that model was completely built out and all errors had been eliminated, I added the next model. In this way, I could follow an error driven development path. Each error guided me to the next step in developing the app.

## Unsolved Problems
+ Allowing a user to select more than one emotion at a time

## Goals

**Bronze**
+ User can choose a single emotion and get a page of corgi images with text and comments
+ User can read and make comments on corgi images

**Silver**
+ More advanced styling
+ Users can submit corgi images

**Gold**
+ Further advanced styling
+ User login
+ Allow logged in users to edit/delete corgis and comments

**Platinum**
- User can choose multiple emotions
